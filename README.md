# Minimalistic Notes App (MERN)

A beginner-friendly full-stack web application to create, update, and delete notes with title and description.  
The project demonstrates how to design and connect a **REST API** with a modern frontend while keeping the architecture simple and clear.

## Description
This app allows users to manage personal notes with a clean and responsive user interface.  
It highlights essential full-stack concepts, including building RESTful endpoints, integrating a NoSQL database, and implementing real-world practices such as rate limiting with Redis.  
Designed as a learning project, it is suitable for anyone starting with full-stack development using the MERN stack.

## Tech Stack
- **MongoDB** – NoSQL database for flexible document storage  
- **Express.js** – Backend framework to handle API routes and middleware  
- **React** – Frontend library for building a dynamic, responsive UI  
- **Node.js** – Runtime environment powering the backend server  
- **Redis (Upstash)** – Demonstrates rate limiting for scalability  
- **dotenv** – Secure environment variable management  
- **Nodemon** – Development utility for automatic server restarts
